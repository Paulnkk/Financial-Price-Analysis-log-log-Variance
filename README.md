# Financial-Price-Analysis-log-log-Variance

I implemented a function calculating the variance (and standard deviation) of time-shifted return fluctuations of high frequency data (approx. 3 Mio rows) supported by multiprocessing functions in Python. The calculations were based on time series data of futures (price per minute) and 10000 discrete time shifts.
